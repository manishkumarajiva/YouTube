This project is built using **Node.js** to simulate YouTube's backend services. It is designed for practice and to learn how various backend features like user authentication, file uploading, and user engagement can be implemented in a real-world application. The project offers core functionalities like **login/logout**, **auth**, **like/comment system**, **playlist management**, **subscription system**, and more!
